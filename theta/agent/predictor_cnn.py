"""
Cascading-1D-CNN failure predictor — architecture scaffolding only.

This module provides a model-loadable predictor that:
  (1) Defines the architecture (cascading 1D CNNs over multi-channel
      time-series telemetry), inspired by Cai et al. 2026 "Forecasting
      Machine Degradation of GPU Clusters" (PRAUC 0.90).
  (2) Loads pre-trained weights from theta/models/bundle/cnn_predictor.pt
      WHEN AVAILABLE, and falls back gracefully to the rule-based
      FailurePredictor when no weights file is present.
  (3) Ships with a training-script outline so operators with their own
      labeled failure data can train the model on their fleet.
  (4) Is HONEST about validation status: this scaffolding does NOT ship a
      pre-trained model. The trained-model path requires labeled failure
      data, which Theta does not yet have at scale. Until the OSS
      telemetry network accumulates labeled events (see [[02_oss_agent_scope]]),
      this module's predict() method returns None and the daemon transparently
      falls back to the rule-based FailurePredictor.

Why ship the scaffolding before the trained model:
  - Pin the architecture contract. When labeled data arrives, training a
    model is a one-script run; the integration is already in place.
  - Make the "we have a real CNN predictor planned, here's the code" claim
    falsifiable. The architecture + the gating logic + the training script
    exist on disk; reviewers can read them.
  - Optional dependency: torch is imported lazily. Hosts without torch
    installed simply never load the model — no impact on daemon startup.

Reference: see [[cai_et_al_summary]] in the vault for the paper's
architectural choices we adopt (multi-channel input, 1D conv over the
time axis, cascading receptive field, PRAUC as primary metric).
