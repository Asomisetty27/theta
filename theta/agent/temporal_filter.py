"""
Temporal Bayesian filter for GPU state classification.

Audit finding addressed: classifier.py runs per-window with NO temporal model.
A single anomalous 15s window can flip state and fire an alert even if 30
windows on either side say "fine" — and there's evidence from related thermal-
monitoring work (Randles et al., 2024) that HMM smoothing reduces false-
positive alert volume by 20–40 % without sacrificing recall.

Design:
  - Treat the per-window classifier output as a NOISY OBSERVATION of a hidden
    state, not as ground truth.
  - Maintain a posterior distribution over GPU states using a discrete-state
    Bayesian filter (this is the discrete-time, finite-state-space limit of a
    Kalman filter — equivalent to running forward inference on an HMM, but
    with no Viterbi back-trace since we want REAL-TIME smoothing, not the
    most likely path through history).
  - Emit a smoothed state + a CALIBRATED probability for that state.

The transition matrix encodes domain knowledge:
  - GPUs rarely jump CLEAN_IDLE → CRITICAL in one tick (15s window).
  - ZOMBIE_RECOVERY tends to persist (CUDA context drains over tens of
    seconds, not instantly).
  - UNDER_LOAD has very strong self-persistence (training jobs run hours).

This makes the agent robust to single-sample classifier glitches (sensor
noise, transient utilization dips, brief power spikes) while still flipping
states quickly when the observation density actually changes — exactly the
property that reduces alert fatigue without delaying real incidents.

#                     stuck retaining power, it can take tens of minutes.
