"""
At-rest credential protection for ~/.theta/config.json.

Audit finding P0 (security): the wizard wrote Redfish BMC username/password
to ~/.theta/config.json in plaintext. If a host is compromised — even at
the user level, since the file lives in $HOME — an attacker can recover
the BMC credentials and pivot to chassis-level access (firmware, fan
control, power-on/off, console).

Threat model and what this DOES and DOES NOT defend against:

  ✓ DOES defend against: opportunistic file-read by another user on the
    host who can `cat ~/.theta/config.json` (assuming HOME is not 0700,
    or via a temp file leak, or a backup archive that ends up off-host).

  ✓ DOES defend against: accidental disclosure (config file committed to
    git, shared as a debug artifact, copied to a support ticket).

  ✗ DOES NOT defend against: an attacker with root who can read the
    machine-id, the keyring, or modify the agent binary.

  ✗ DOES NOT defend against: an attacker who already has the agent's
    Python interpreter running with the same key material.

This is realistic data-at-rest hygiene, not a hardware-secured vault. We
encrypt with a key DERIVED from machine-stable identifiers (machine-id +
the agent install location) using PBKDF2 — so the encrypted blob is bound
to this host. Move the file to another box and decryption fails.

When the cryptography library is unavailable, we fall back to a NON-CRYPTO
obfuscation (base64 XOR with the machine key). This is explicitly weaker
and a warning is logged on every read/write so the operator knows to
`pip install cryptography`. We DON'T silently store secrets in plaintext.
